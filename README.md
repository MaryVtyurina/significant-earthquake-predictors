# significant-earthquake-predictors

This repository was created as a part of research in Saint Petersburg State University. We provide two types of datasets with cleaned data and filled NaNs. We also provide several model for feature selection.

### Prerequisites

You might need to install pytorch before running the models. https://pytorch.org

### Data

Data about earthquakes was taken from USGS website (https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes)

The ionisphere data was taken from:
* National centers for environmental information NOAA - https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/iono/ionogram.html
* National Institute of Information and Communication Technology in Japan NICT - http://wdc.nict.go.jp/IONO/HP2009/ISDJ/index-E.html 

### Filling missing values
### Datasets
### Models
#### Linear Regression + PCA
#### Linear Regression + L1 regularisation
#### Neural network
